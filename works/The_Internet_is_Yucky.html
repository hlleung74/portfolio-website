              <p>Have you ever googled the images of fictional characters and then added the word "horror" at the end of the search bar, like "Elmo Horror"? Oh… you haven't tried it before? Okay! Let's do this together, shall we?</p>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/elmo_horror.png" class="full-size-img">
              </div>
              <p>After looking at the search result above, what do you instinctively feel? Terrified? Scared? Disgusted? Maybe you get goose pimples? Or are you shuddering? Perhaps the word "Yuck!" is echoing inside your brain? If that's the case, you are probably getting the yuck factor.</p>

              <h2>The Yuck Factor</h2>
              <p>
                The yuck factor describes our instinctive physical responses when encountering naturally dangerous objects or unnatural ideas, with external symptoms ranging from sweat on the skin to nausea (Bassett, 2006). The former component, naturally dangerous objects, refers to the scary things that are culturally agreed upon, which can mostly be found in horror movies or haunted houses, such as blood, guts, and organs without bodies. Unnatural ideas refer to the concepts that society has not yet agreed on, like cloning and women's equal rights.
              </p>
              <p>
                As mentioned by Bassett (2006), beholders are the ones that get the yuck factor. Since everyone holds different opinions, especially on unnatural ideas, the yuck factor varies from person to person. Take an artwork that promotes women's equal pay rights on Redbubble (Figure 2) as an example. Maybe the artists were feminists, so they thought it was a natural action to support feminism by selling this work. However, when a misogynist sees the artwork, the yuck factor might arise in that person. In other words, whether an object "emits" the yuck factor depends on an individual's ideology.
              </p>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/equal_pay_for_equal_work.jpeg" class="thirty-size-img">
              </div>
              <p class="img-description">Figure 1: An artwork promoting women's equal pay for work on Redbubble (lovenotdivision, n.d.)</p>
              <p>
                This concept, the yuck factor, originally came from Arthur Caplan, a University of Pennsylvania bioethicist (Schmidt, 2008). Later in 1997, the term was praised by Leon Kass, the chairman of the U.S. President's Council on Bioethics, and he called it "the wisdom of repugnance" (Kass, 1997). Although more than 25 years have already passed since its creation, the yuck factor is still a crucial concept that facilitates meaningful discussions these days.
              </p>
              
              <h2>The Mixed Blessing of the Yuck Factor</h2>
              <p>
                Diving into the yuck factor is of prime importance, as it helps revolutionize society. Although the yuck factor is a response to distinguish danger based on fear and disgust (Bassett, 2006), this doesn't mean we should avoid the objects causing it. As stated by Kass (1997), "repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it". The yuck factor is our instinct, so we may experience its symptoms before we recognize it. If we leave our yuck factors at that, this can hinder the future development of society. Like the example Bassett (2006) suggested about the women's right to vote. Women can now enjoy this right, because they advanced from what was viewed as their biological destiny decades ago. If people were chained by their yuck factor at the time, society could never progress to what it is today. Hence, we should acknowledge the yuck factor, accepting it to guide our actions and future (Bassett, 2006).
              </p>
              <p>
                Admittedly, the yuck factor is not always wholesome, especially when ill-intended people abuse its use: the ugly side of the yuck factor started arising on YouTube in 2014 with Elsagate. This Elsagate phenomenon refers to the widespread of inappropriate fan-made YouTube kid content featuring popular family-friendly fictional characters, such as Elsa from Frozen (Hernández-Santaolalla & Barrientos-Bueno, 2020). Those contents utilize the yuck factor to bring in more views, presenting ideas that are unnatural to children, such as pornography (Figure 2) and violence (Figure 3). Exposure to this type of 18+ content at a young age causes severe harmful effects. According to UNICEF (n.d.), exposing children to pornography may lead to adverse outcomes, such as poor mental health and sexual violence. Regarding exposure to violence, children may be more likely to suffer depression, substance abuse, and other mental health problems (National Institute of Justice, 2016).

              </div>
              <p class="img-description">Figure 2: Example of Elsagate videos involving pornography that have many views (Satherley, 2017)</p>
              <div class="img-container">

              <p class="img-description">Figure 3: Example of Elsagate videos involving violence that have many views (Trust and Safety Foundation, 2021)</p>
              <p>
                As those yuck factor content attracted many views, content creators earned a lot of money with ad revenue. More and more Elsagate content appeared on the platform. Luckily, this trend was finally put on hold after YouTube demonetized the videos that make inappropriate use of beloved fictional characters. 
              </p>

              <h2>Obsession with The Yuck Factor</h2>
              <p>
                Despite the Elsagate controversy tarnishing the reputation of the yuck factor, enthusiasts do not stop including the yuck factor in their artworks and spreading them through social media. On Reddit, the subreddit r/imsorryjon is flooded with thousands upon thousands of Garfield horror Internet art. As illustrated in Figure 4, one of r/imsorryjon's rules is that all content must have horror elements, instilling a sense of fear or disgust. The types of horror can be body horror, existential horror, and cosmic Lovecraftian horror. In other words, the horror in r/imsorryjon is the same as the naturally dangerous objects from the yuck factor.
              </p>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/imsorrjon_rules.png" class="thirty-size-img">
              </div>
              <p class="img-description">Figure 4: The rules of the r/imsorryjon subreddit (Reddit, n.d.)</p>
              <p>
                By solely looking at the artworks posted on r/imsorryjon (e.g., Figures 5a to 5d), the members of r/imsorryjon are a bunch of crazy maniacs who vilify Garfield, our adorable orange cat.
              </p>
              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/imsorryjon_1.webp" class="thirty-size-img">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/imsorryjon_2.webp" class="thirty-size-img">

              <div class="img-container">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/imsorryjon_3.webp" class="thirty-size-img">
                <img src="../assets/img/works/imsorryjon_4.webp" class="thirty-size-img">
              </div>
              <p class="img-description"> Figure 5a (Top Left) (loki0203, 2019). Figure 5b (Top Right) (Rojom, 2019). Figure 5c (Bottom Left) (Rojom, 2019). Figure 5d (Bottom Right) (Rojom, 2019).</p>
              <p>
                However, I believe from r/imsorryjon members' point of view, they wholeheartedly love Garfield as a character and integrate the yuck factor into their artworks to express their love. By referring to r/imsorryjon's description (Figure 6), this subreddit aims to celebrate Garfield's reincarnation. The members of this subreddit are not producing any Elsagate content to attract clouds; instead, they are exploring the possibility of what Garfield can become.

              <p>
                From the name “the yuck factor” alone, the concept is only about disgust. Yet, the deeper we look into the yuck factor, the more we recognise that it is worth examining. Through discussion, this power of disgust becomes a tool for discovery, enabling us to explore the wisdom of our repugnance. With proper use of the yuck factor, our society becomes a better place for us to live in. At the same time, if we misuse the yuck factor for our own benefit, the beholders might suffer from unfavourable impacts. The consequences can become much more severe with the rise in popularity of social media. People are exposed to more yuck factors, as social media allows people to share and transmit their thoughts easily. Hence, we should consider our actions carefully when the yuck factors are involved.
