              <h2>Astonishing Journey into the Virtual World</h2>
              <p>
                We Met in Virtual Reality (2022), directed, produced, edited, and written by Joe Hunting, is a 91-minute documentary filmed entirely inside VRChat, an online virtual world platform that allows people to interact with each other in the form of virtual avatars. The film presents heart-warming events from Winter 2020 to Summer 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic in VRChat (Hunting, n.d.) and a collage of authentic stories told by people there. Hunting captured those scenes handheld in real-time with VRC Lens (Struss, 2022), the virtual camera that functions similarly to real-life cameras (Wilkinson, 2022), immersing the audiences into the virtual reality world without additional equipment. Moreover, he intended to engage audiences in the virtual world with his artistic choice of addressing people in VRChat only by their usernames and avatars without any real-life imagery (Hunting, n.d.).
              </p>
              <p>
                Hunting made the documentary from a place of passion to VRChat, intended to enlighten audiences on the growing social virtual reality culture by sharing the personal stories of people there (Hunting, n.d.). The documentary emphasises four groups of people: Jenny (Fig. 1) from the sign language community Helping Hands, DragonHeart and IsYourBoi (Fig. 2) from the exotic VR dance community Club Zodiac, DustBunny and Toaster (Fig. 3) from VR dance community, and Scout, DylandP, MooseStash, and Kevin (Fig. 4) from the Better Together VR group. Their stories delve into themes of belonging, mental health, and self-expression, which was something Hunting wished to explore in his film since the beginning (Struss, 2022). On closer inspection, their experiences reflect that the virtual reality world has helped them improve their lives in those aspects. Through examining virtuality’s social impacts on belonging, mental health, and self-expression, Joe Hunting’s We Met in Virtual Reality sheds light on how the virtual reality world is a place of empowerment.

              <h2>From Belonging to Empowerment</h2>
              <p>
                By focusing on the environment of two communities in VRChat: Jenny’s Helping Hands, and DragonHeart’s and IsYourBoi’s Club Zodiac, Hunting reflects people who strive to build people’s sense of belonging to the virtual world are being empowered and empowering others.
              </p>
              <p>
                To begin with, Jenny, an ASL sign language teacher at Helping Hands, was dedicated to maintaining a safe and welcoming environment for everyone there. She mentioned that Helping Hands, having 2,000 members at the time of filming, aimed “not only [to] educate people about sign language and the deaf community, but also just to create an environment where people can have fun, make friends.” As a teacher in the Helping Hands community, she tried to create people’s sense of belonging to the community, making them “feel like they have a home” at VRChat. Hunting’s emphasis on Jenny reflects the empowerment people who make the virtual world a better place have. In the documentary, Jenny was confident when delivering the goals of Helping Hands. And as a teacher of her community, she had the same purpose and bared the responsibility to make the virtual world welcoming. Her upbeat demeanour when interacting with her class suggested that Jenny actively took actionable steps to achieve her goal. She focused on her drive and had the power to make decisions that guided her towards her goal. It can be seen that she was empowered in the process of achieving the goal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another example is the admin of the Club Zodiac community. Before introducing DragonHeart and IsYourBoi to the audiences, Hunting presented some scenes that were shot inside Club Zodiac. In one clip, an admin maintained orders by giving out instructions before the dance performances. She ended her speech by reminding members to report people making the place unsafe, stating, “if anyone creeps you guys out, let us know right there. Do not wait, okay? Don’t wait. We pay attention to what is going on around the room, and we are also pretty protective of you guys, as well too, so yes, please let us know.” Other minor details in the film imply people being empowered in the virtual world because of the actions of people like Jenny and the admin at Club Zodiac. This documentary was filmed during the COVID-19 pandemic when people faced intense isolation in the physical world. Yet, the film contains many moments of people having fun, such as during classes (Fig. 5) and at bars (Fig. 6) — relationship blossoms between people in the virtual world, which sometimes even extends to the physical world. For example, DustBunny and Toaster became couples via this virtual world, and then they flew to each other’s country to meet up in real life. By having a welcoming and supportive environment in the virtual world, people felt they belonged and trusted others in the community, developing genuine relationships. Otherwise, they would not feel safe to open up to each other on a deeper level, like in real life. While many people were alone in quarantine in the physical world, the virtual world provided them with a support system that people could turn to for emotional support. With the sense of belongings people have in the virtual world, this safety net empowers people since they feel more control over their decisions with the support they receive.

              <h2>From Mental Health to Empowerment</h2>
              <p>
                Although going into the virtual world to escape from the physical world sound pessimistic, Hunting’s depictions of IsYourBoi’s and DragonHeart’s stories made audiences understand that running into the virtual world could be better for people’s mental health, being self-empowered in the process.
              </p>
              <p>
                VRChat is a gateway to escape the physical world for both IsYourBoi and DragonHeart. IsYourBoi described VRChat as an escape when she first discovered the platform. She recalled that she had lost one of her family and was in a dark place. In real life, people around told her things like, “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss.” These constant reminders made her unable to be herself. With VRChat being her coping mechanism, she could forget her sadness and have fun because no one knew what had happened to her, which she needed at the time. And DragonHeart used VRChat to isolate himself from the stress he had in the physical world. He hopped on the virtual world after work to unwind and enjoy time with his friends.
              </p>
              <p>
                Everyone deals with their issues differently, and maybe staying in the virtual world is better than the physical world. Take IsYourBoi, for instance. To properly cope with her grief, she needed to be away from the real world and people to treat her normally. Although the journey for her might be long and painful, by looking at the way she told her story, the audience can feel that she recovered from her loss with the help of virtual reality. Despite continue staying in VRChat, she did so because of another reason: her passion as a dancer. Like DragonHeart, IsYourBoi spent her time in the virtual world to relax and deal with the stress she encountered in the real world. By maintaining a balance between their real and virtual lives, IsYourBoi and DragonHeart were in better mental health. Their use of VRChat for self-care helped them develop more positive attitudes towards life, empowering them during their time in the virtual world.
              </p>
              
              <h2>From Self-Expression to Empowerment</h2>
              <p>
                Hunter included Toaster’s and DylanP’s stories about being more comfortable in their skin in the virtual world than the physical world, demonstrating how the anonymity and avatars offered by the virtual world help improve one’s empowerment.
              </p>
              <p>
                For Toaster, he liked VRChat because he wanted to be free from certain expectations placed on him in real life. Toaster mentioned that he could be free to be himself in virtual reality because “nobody knows who [he is]” and “nobody cares who [he was]”. He was happy that people “just know who [he is] now, how [he treats] them, how [he speaks] to them” and relieved to be himself. DylanP had a similar desire for freedom from social expectations as Toaster. As a non-binary person, DylanP enjoyed being able to represent themselves more fluidly with avatars in VRChat, which “[was something] harder to achieve in real life because of the expectations of society”. They can switch between avatars effortlessly and “run around as a space dog, as a deer, as a Nargacuga, like any number of different avatars that [they] collect across different worlds or that [they] make [themselves].”
              </p>
              <p>
                Toaster and DylanP are not alone in struggling with self-expression due to expectations in the physical world. In fact, it is not uncommon to hear on social media that people have preferences that go against social norms. For example, they want to express themselves in the forms that are commonly frowned upon, such as cross-dressing and dressing up as furry. Given the side-eyes they would receive if they were true to themselves in the physical world, people need to hide their authentic selves to fit in. Being unable to be the one to take charge of their actions can be suffocating, making them feel trapped in real life. However, with virtual reality being an option, people can take active roles in expressing themselves freely without worrying about real-life repercussions. Some enjoy being anime girls, while others enjoy being non-human objects, such as hotdogs and sofas. The virtual world becomes a safe space for people to make positive decisions based on their wants, empowering them to accept who they are and be positive about themselves.
              </p>

              <h2>The Good and The Bad of the Virtual World</h2>
              <p>
                Overall, Hunting took careful consideration in depicting the positive aspects of the virtual world in his documentary We Met in Virtual Reality. By immersing audiences in VRChat, they gained enlightenment about the positive social impacts of virtuality in terms of belonging, mental health, and self-expression. This essay delved into how Hunting demonstrated those themes by assessing the scenes he included in his documentary. Firstly, to study the sense of belongings people in the virtual world have, Hunting centred around the environment in VRChat, namely two communities to be specific: Helping Hands and Club Zodiac. After that, by sharing the stories of IsYourBoi and DragonHeart about their mental health, the documentary highlights how the virtual world helped people with their well-being. Then, Hunter presented Toaster’s and DylanP’s stories, indicating how people can express themselves in the virtual world. Subsequently, within each theme, the essay carried the discussion further by examining the empowerment of people in virtual worlds built because of those social impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although Hunting’s documentary casts the virtual world in a positive light, this does not mean a world like VRChat has no drawbacks. In an interview with TIME (Chow, 2022), Hunting did acknowledge the potential harm the virtual world has, including difficulties in returning to the real, physical world. Similar to other online platforms, VRChat can simultaneously be good and bad. It is of paramount importance for people to bear this in mind when immersing themselves in the virtual world.
